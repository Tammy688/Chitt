	Chitt is a class assignment attempting to utilize various concepts learned during my TTS Immersion Program. We were instructed to develop an app similar to Twitter. The user should be able to post statuses (Chittles) and comments (Chatters). Chitt and respective items were my attempt at creatively naming resources. Please bear with me. :)

	My background stems from Choral Music and audio engineering, to my 9-5's in various office support capacities. I've played around with beginner level site building with apps like Wix, Wordpress, Tumblr and GoDaddy. Google Apps is my favorite business services suites right now. I enjoy building things that belong on the web but felt limited with my previous skillset. That's why I decided to enroll in an immersion program and hopefully I'll get the chance to work under a patient developer who can expose me to better practices and innovative tools.
